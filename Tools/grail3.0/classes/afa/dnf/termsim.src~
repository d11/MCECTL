		int find_dif(unsigned a, unsigned b)

Description:
	This function tests if a-b = pow(2,i) for some integer i.
	It is assumed that a > b.

Parameters:
	unsigned a,b		

Return Values:
	i		-if a-b = pow(2,i) for some integer i
	-1		-otherwise

		int term::combine(const term& t, unsigned *ord_inv)

Description:
	This function is a public member of the "term" class (declared in term.h).
	This function simplifies (*this) OR t, according to two rules:

	(i) For two terms t1,t2 defined on set S={x1,..,xn} and its dual set ~S,
		(t1 <= t2) -> ((t1 OR t2)=t1)
	    Where <= means that every Boolean variable which appears in t1 appears in t2 in 
	    the same form.
	(ii)If t1 = x3(y)x4 and t2 = x3(~y)x4 for some var x3,y,x4 in S,
            then (t1 OR t2) = x3x4

	This function is the same as the one below, exept much faster, because it receives
 	the ord_inv array.  This array is the inverse of the array containing  all elements 
	of B**n in order of increasing weight.  (See classes/afa/manage_bitvec.src for details).
	This results in much faster bit-vector handling.

Parameters:
	const term& t			-term to simplify with	
	unsigned *ord_inv		-see classes/afa/manage_bitvec.src for details	

Return Values:
	1				-if *this term and term t were simplified;
				         ( *this term is changed to the simplified logical
					   OR result)
	0				-otherwise
