                       re<S>* re<S>::parse(istream& str)

  Description:
    This function is a public member of the template class re (declared 
    in classes/re/re.h).  This function attempts to read and parse a regular
    expression from the parameter input stream.  The input stream must be
    valid and open before calling this function.  The expression must be
    terminated by a right bracket, a star, or the end of the input stream.
    The function calls term(istream&) to start the parsing.  term(istream&) 
    will get either a bracketed expression, a symbol, the empty set, the 
    empty string or a term followed by a star from the stream and return it.
    If there is still more on the stream, parse(istream&) will handle
    catenating or performing union on the next input.  In other words,
    a regular expression interpreted as either a term, the catenation of
    two expressions or the union of two expressions.  The function returns
    a pointer to the regular expression which was read.

    This function can be called in the following way:
      new_re = this_re.parse(input_stream);

  Parameters:
    istream& str - the stream from which the expression should be read

  Return Value:
    re<S>* - a pointer to the new regular expression

  Note:
    This function is very closely coupled with term(istream&).  It should 
    perhaps be redesigned to make the structure simpler.  It is not
    apparent why the handling of star is in both this function and 
    term(istream&) since the code in this function should never be executed.
